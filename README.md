The lifecycle is the way that all Android apps interact with the Android OS. In the same way that the lifecycle of humans enables them to interact with the world around them, we have no choice but to interact with the Android lifecycle and we must be prepared to handle numerous unpredictable events if we want our apps to survive.

Functions:
 onCreate()
 onStart()
 onResume()
 onPause()
 onStop()
 onDestroy()
